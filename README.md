# Patika.dev Adventure Game Project
We are creating a text-based adventure game in Java language with the help of Object-Oriented Programming principles.

 We enter a username and choose a character depending on its damage, health and money. We can stay in Safe House where the enemies cannot attack us or buy weapon and armours if the money is enough in the Store. Then we choose a location which converts us random number of monsters to defeat in order to collect specific items(food,water,firewood). If we defeat all monsters before our heart points become zero, we earn prize money from each monsters and receive the items as award. Then we can turn back to the Safe House and recharge our heart points to full.
